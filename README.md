# My Landing Page!

Welcome to my landing page! This website was a fun front-end challenge for me. 

At the time that I built this website, I had built many webpages that were static, meaning that they didn't really have any animations outside of toast notifications. I also built them to pre-determined UI/UX specifications.

For this website, I wanted to challenge myself to do some new things that would make my website pop. This included plenty of CSS Animations and scrapping multiple design concepts until I found one that not only felt right, but looked great!
