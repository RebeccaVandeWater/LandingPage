        Hi, I'm Rebecca!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with an enthusiasm about learning and problem-solving. I have experience as an
        educator, and an appreciation for equity, mindfulness, and the way I can impact my community in a positive way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I taught a variety of classrooms and students over three years as an Elementary School Educator. This included
        classrooms in Title 1 schools with a high poverty and refugee population, and online classrooms of students who
        started their education during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br> This experience has allowed me to see how online
        applications can help users from all backgrounds access important care and resources, or just stay in contact with
        their friends and loved ones! I aspire to build applications that are accessible to all types of users, and which
        have feature-rich interactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies include playing in and running D&D games, gardening, and embroidery. I love spending time with my
        family, and finding new adventures that widen my knowledge and understanding of the world around me ðŸŒŽ
